        <p>Rynok Square (also called Market Square) has been a social and economic center of Lviv for centuries. It is known as a downtown of the city. It has gained its present architectural appearance after 1527, when a great fire destroyed the entire downtown. Over the next decades around the City Hall were built forty&ndash;four private houses in the prevailing Renaissance, Baroque and Classicist styles. On the ground floor of the buildings usually were located workshops and small stores. And the first owners of these houses were Italians, Greeks, Ukrainians, Poles and Germans. Today the Square is a popular place for public assemblies and important celebrations.</p>
        <p>Lviv Rynok Square has a total of four fountains at each side &mdash; Diana, Neptune, Adonise and Amphitrite. Local Lviv residents give their special love to Neptune. &ldquo;Where shall we meet?&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;At Neptune!&rdquo; is a typical phrase in conversations of Lviv university students. Whenever you come to the fountain, expect to see bunches and crowds of young people and elderly all ready for their afternoon rendezvouz. There are also many restaurants, cafes, bars, museums and artisan shops, so you will definetely love it.</p>

        <p>How about spending 15 min counting up all the steps in Lviv Town Hall? The first Town Hall in Lviv was built in 1381, however, it was rebuilt many times, and once was completely burnt down during the big fire in 17th century. Current building dates back to 19th century and offers one of the best aerial views of the city! The tower of Lviv City Hall is 65 meters high and there is magnificent panorama of the city&rsquo;s old central part on the tower.</p>
        <p>Getting to its top is one of the most fun things to do in Lviv! This is no a simple task though, as just to get to the ticket office you have climb 103 steps. And after that you&rsquo;ve got to tackle another 305 before you come to that vista of the city and its famous hills. As stairs start to wind up to the tiny round tube at the top of the tower, the counting is even more interesting! Climbing up of wooden stairs, you will be able to see the old German clock, which keeps track of time. The Town Hall bell works depending on it and rings every 15 minutes with melodic sound.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>High Castle Hill</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The park is located on the highest mountain overlooking the old part of the city. In the past, it was a favorite place for a walk among the burghers and city elite. The hill, also known as Vysoky Zamok, used to be a wooden fortress, built in the 13th century by King Lev. The structure was destroyed and then rebuilt again from stone a century late. Castle served as a residence for King&rsquo;s steward and as a prison, but fell apart some hundred years later. Nowadays, only fragments of old walls remind about place&rsquo;s former glory. It offers a quiet refuge from the busy city streets, and it has indubitably the best aerial views of the city. Come just at sunrise in summer and you may have it completely to yourself.</p>

        <p>Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre is one of the most famous buildings in Europe. Known as the Grand Theater originally, it is now formally called The Lviv National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet of Solomiya Krushelnyts&rsquo;ka, in honor of Ukraine&rsquo;s most well&ndash;known female opera singer. The Lviv Opera House was built in 1900 using forms of Renaissance and Baroque architecture. As a result it is one of the most beautiful opera houses in Europe with a luxurious interior, including the Mirror Hall and Parnassus Curtain and a stunning facade with ornate sculpture work. For the curious ones, the Theater stands right at the top of river Poltva, that used to run across the city until some hundred years ago.

            <li>Citadel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The special military and defensive construction was built in 1852&ndash;1854 for the Austrian military garrison. The round tower system was designed according to the project of General Maximilian&ndash;Joseph d&rsquo;Este. The Citadel is located on a strategic hill, overlooking the old part of the city. Understanding the danger of a war with the Russian Empire, the Austro&ndash;Hungarian Empire cared about the security of the city. However, eventually the reality turned out to be very different, as in 1914 the Austro&ndash;Hungarian troops left the city almost without a fight, and there was located a Russian garrison for several months in the citadel.</p>
        <p>The most terrible part of the citadel history was during the Second World War. There was located the Stalag&ndash;328 concentration camp organized by Nazis, where they tortured many Red Army prisoners, as well as Italian soldiers, after Italy decided to emerge from the war. Since 1991 the office space has been located in former bastions and barracks.</p>

        <p>The Boim Chapel is one of the most important architectural gems of Lviv. Its construction began in 1609 on order of the rich merchant Yurii (George) Boim and lasted until 1615. The figure of the grieving Christ on the top of the dome impresses the travelers the most. The Boim family left its noticeable mark in the history of Lviv. They hold the positions of town councillors, while the grandson of Yurii Boim Mykhailo held the post of official ambassador of the Vatican in China after graduating from the best educational institutions of the Polish&ndash;Lithuanian Commonwealth. Experts compare the Lviv chapel with the tomb in the Krakow Wawel. There are no more analogs of the Boim Chapel in Europe.</p>
