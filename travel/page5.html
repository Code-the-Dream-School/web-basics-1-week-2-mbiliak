        <h3>About the Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Hi people. I am Maria Biliak. I am a student at Wilbur Wright College. I created this project for Web Development I class. I was born in Ukraine, my home country. I came to the USA two years ago and decided to become a web developer. In my free time, I like to play guitar, watch movies and spend time with my family and friends.</p>
        
        <p>I decided to write about Ukraine and the most beautiful city in the western part of country - Lviv. I like this city so much, so I want more people know about it. I lived and worked in Lviv for one year and it was the most colorful and amazing time in my life. Lviv has become the most attractive tourist city of Ukraine. There are plenty of things to do, from chocolate shops, to plentiful cozy cafes and rustic beer breweries. It is the city, where people wait for you with a cup of coffee and warm hugs. I highly recommend to visit it.</p>
